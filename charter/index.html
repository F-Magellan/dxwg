				<h2>Goals</h2>
		        <p>The goal of the working group is to maintain version 2 of the DCAT standard and develop it further in line with wider practice but also to recognize and support diverse approaches to data description and Dataset Exchange more generally.  The working group will also develop a primer on the use of version 2 of DCAT and any subsequent updates that will help organisations adopt this standard.</p>

			</section>

            <section id="scope" class="scope">
                <h2>Scope</h2>
<p>DCAT is formulated as an RDF vocabulary and is expected to remain so, however, the working Group is agnostic about data formats. Methods for expressing DCAT in other (existing) formats are in scope.</p>
<p>Government data, scientific research data, industry/enterprise and cultural heritage data, whether shared openly or not, are all explicitly in scope.</p>
                <section id="input-documents">
                    <h3>Input Documents</h3>
                    <p>The following documents <i>SHOULD</i> be considered by the Working Group as direct inputs to the specifications to be developed.</p>

                    <h5>W3C documents</h5>
                    <ul>

                        <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/">Data Quality</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-duv/">Dataset Usage</a> vocabularies</li>
                        <li>The Smart Data &amp; Smarter Descriptions (SDSVoc) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/11/sdsvoc/report">workshop report</a>, in particular the section on content negotiation by application profile.</li>
                     <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/">Data on the Web Best Practices</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Non-W3C documents</h5>
<p>DCAT must take account of current practice in many different communities. The following list is therefore not exhaustive.</p>

            <li><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/description">DCAT-AP</a> and related work, such as <a href="https://doc.difi.no/dcat-ap-no/">DCAT-AP-NO</a>, <a href="https://www.dati.gov.it/content/dcat-ap-it-v10-profilo-italiano-dcat-ap-0">DCAT-AP-IT</a>, <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/geodcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe">GeoDCAT-AP</a>, <a href="https://www.dcat-ap.de/">DCAT-AP.de</a> etc. </li>

                    <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
                    <p>The Dataset Exchange Working Group will not create application profiles or metadata standards that only apply to very specific domains (such as particle physics, accountancy, oncology etc.)</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
                    <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, the WG should show that each term in the revised version of DCAT is used in multiple catalogs and related systems. As a minimum, evidence will be adduced that each term has been published and consumed independently at least once, although a higher number is expected for the majority of terms.</p>
<p>For the content negotiation by application profile specification, each fall back mechanism identified by the Working Group is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">two independent implementations</a>. The DXWG is not responsible for proving implementations of the RFC defined at IETF.</p>
<p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
<p>Testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>

                <h2 id="participation"> Participation </h2>
                <p>
                    To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from key implementors and users (e.g, governments and research data managers) of this specification, and active Editors. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.</p>

                <p>The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.</p>

                <p>The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.</p>

                <h2> Communication </h2>
                <p id="public">
                    Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
                </p>

                <p>Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="/2017/dxwg/">Dataset Exchange Working Group home page</a>.</p>

                <p>This group primarily conducts its technical work: on the public mailing list <a id="public-email" href="mailto:public-dxwg-wg@w3.org">public-dxwg-wg@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dxwg-wg/">archive</a>). The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.</p>

                <p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="decisions">
                <h2> Decision Policy </h2>
                <p>
                    This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
