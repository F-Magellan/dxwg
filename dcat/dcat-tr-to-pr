Minor editorial changes have been made:
 - [PR 1125](https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/pull/1125) has updated the owl version in dcat.ttl;
 - [PR 1127](https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/pull/1127) has uniformed the use of blanks and punctuation in the literals included in dcat.ttl;
 - [PR 1135]([https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/pull/1135](https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/pull/1135)) has fixed coordinate order in ga-courts example;
 - [PR 1136](https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/pull/1136) has inserted a note in section DCAT History to clarify that DCAT 2 maintains the DCAT namespace as it preserves backward compatibility with DCAT;
 - [PR 1140](https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/pull/1140) has revised some class descriptions. It has removed descriptions of dcat:accessRights and dct:license for dcat:DataServices. These descriptions were redundant as they are already provided in the class dcat:Resource from which the two properties are inherited;
- [PR 1142](https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/pull/1142) has updated the acknowledgements;
 - [PR 1141](https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/pull/1141) and [PR 1143](https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/pull/1143) have updated the link to implementation report;

# Wide Review


There was some discussion about the use of "conforms to" (see https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1130 ) and this has been carried forward into future work that will perhaps be undertaken in a DCAT Primer document.
