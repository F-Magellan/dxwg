    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This document describes how Internet clients may negotiate for content provided by servers according to
      <em>profiles</em>. This is distinct from negotiating by Media Type or Language: the <em>profile</em> is expected
      to specify the content of information returned, which may be a subset of the information the responding server has about the requested resource, and may be structured in a specific way to meet interoperability requirements of a community of practice.

    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="introduction" class="informative">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Content delivered by dereferencing Internet identifiers can be negotiated for in different
      ways. When using the HTTP protocol [[RFC7230]], a client may set one or more headers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>an <code>Accept</code> header specifying preferred Media Types which the server may or may not supply</li>
      <li>an <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header to request that a specific content encoding system be used</li>
      <li>an <code>Accept-Language</code> header to indicate a preferred language</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, clients have not had a
      defined way to negotiate for content based on its adherence to an information model - a standard, a specification or
      a <a>profile</a> - and this document describes how this functionality can be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When online information about a resource adheres to one or more profiles, methods described here allow
      clients to list those profiles and request content according to one or more of them in order of preference.
      For example, information about an online book might adhere to the Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]] metadata
      specification with each field, such as <em>title</em>, <em>description</em>, <em>author</em> etc.,
      being defined and formatted according to various Dublin Core elements (<code>dct:title</code>,
      <code>dct:description</code> &amp; <code>dct:creator</code>, respectively). Then, a request for the information about this
      book may ask for the list of profiles according to which the metadata is available, or it may ask specifically for a response adhering to the
      Dublin Core Terms. When no profile or an unsupported profile is requested, a server returns default content, that
      is, content conforming to the default profile supported by the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      When selecting a content negotiation mechanism, an Internet client may use the HTTP protocol but it may also use
      other methods for providing instructions to a server,
      such as URI Query String Arguments (<abbr title="Query String Arguments">QSAs</abbr>).
      QSAs are
      established as useful for humans and machines for situations where negotiation via HTTP is not practical, such
      as when manually entering requests into web browsers. This document also provides guidance for both HTTP and non-HTTP methods
      of content negotiation and ensures they all adhere to a single functional specification, ensuring their functional equivalency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guidance for the creation of <a>profile</a>s is provided in the [[PROF-GUIDANCE]] document created
      by the Dataset Exchange Working Group (DXWG).
    </p>
    <p>
      Describing the parts of profiles and their relation to other profiles is the function of the Profiles Vocabulary
      [[PROF]], also produced by the DXWG.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      In many cases, there are several ways to describe a resource within the scope of a single Media Type.
      For instance, XML documents, while conforming to the <code>text/xml</code> Media Type, may adhere to one of
      several DTDs or XML Schemas. RDF documents, with a choice of Media Type serializations such as
      <code>text/turtle</code>, <code>application/rdf+xml</code> and others, have a large number of vocabularies
      (classes and properties) available to use for their content's information model. When a client initiates a request
      for an Internet resource, such as an HTTP GET to retrieve a resource or an HTTP PUT to create or replace a resource, the client and server must have a standardized way to exchange information on how the transmitted resource
      will be structured according to DTDs, XML Schema, vocabularies or other standards, specifications or
      <em>profiles</em>. When using non-HTTP content negotiation, various methods such as URIs with Query String
      Arguments have been implemented previously,
      such as the
      <abbr title="Open Archives Initiative - Protocol for Metadata Harvesting">OAI-PMH</abbr> [[OAI-PMH]] and
      <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr>'s
      <abbr title="Catalogue Service for the Web">CSW</abbr> [[CSW]] protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document describes an abstract, functions-based, model for content negotiation by profile and gives both the
      HTTP header <em>realization</em> and also a recommended query string argument-based <em>realization</em> too. The query string
	   approach provides a "fall back" required by the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/charter">Dataset Exchange Working Group's Charter</a> (Section 2.3). Other query string or REST-based <em>realizations</em>
      are considered possible but are not given here. In general, existing APIs that support specification of alternative
      profiles for resource representations may support this model too by implementing its functions.

  <section id="relatedwork" class="informative">
    <h2>Related Work</h2>
    <p>
      The standardization of the content-negotiation HTTP headers is the purview of the IETF. A first proposal
      for an <a href="https://profilenegotiation.github.io/I-D-Accept--Schema/I-D-accept-schema">Internet Draft
      for Negotiating Profiles in HTTP</a> [[PROF-IETF]] is available but has not yet been submitted to the IETF. The
      current version of the IETF draft (-00) is expected to be completely re-written in parallel work with this document and should
      not be seen as anything but work-in-progress.
    </p>
    <section id="related-http">
      <h3>Existing standards for transporting profile information in HTTP headers</h3>
      <h4>Using Accept/Content Type together with the profile parameter</h4>
      <p>The HTTP Accept and Content-Type header fields [[RFC7231]]
        allow a client to specify acceptable media types (<code>Accept</code>)
        and a server to indicate the media type of the payload (<code>Content-Type</code>).
        A media type registration can also specify an optional list of media type parameters.
        Some media type registrations (e. g. <code>application/ld+json</code>)
        have specified the use of a media type parameter named "profile"
        that could be used to signal the profile the payload of the message conforms to.</p>
      <pre class="example nohighlight" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite" title="Using the profile parameter in an Accept header together with the Accept-Profile header">
  GET /some/resource HTTP/1.1
  Accept: text/turtle;q=0.9;profile="urn:example:profile-1",
    text/turtle;q=0.7;profile="urn:example:profile-2"

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/turtle;profile="urn:example:profile-2"
  </pre>
      <p>During TPAC 2018 in Lyon, the DXWG had a longer discussion with the JSON-LD WG
    and it was concluded that the “profile” parameter in the <code>Accept</code> and <code>Content-Type</code>
    headers should be seen to convey profiles that are specific to the media-type,
    such as the JSON-LD profiles "expanded" (<code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded</code>) or
    "flattened" (<code>http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#flattened</code>).
    In order to signal the use of media-type-independent profiles,
    the http header fields <code>Accept-Profile</code> and <code>Content-Profile</code> are to be used.</p>
      <h4>Using a Link-header with rel=”profile” (RFC 6906)</h4>
      <p>The HTTP Link header field [[RFC8288]] relates a web resource (Link Context)
    to a target resource (Link Target
    by specifying the relation between the two resources.
    One of the relation types is “profile” as defined in [[RFC6906]].
        [[RFC6906]] <a data-cite="RFC6906#section-3">defines a profile</a> as
        "additional semantics that can be used to process a resource representation […]
        that do not alter the basic media type semantics,"
        and specifically states that
        "creators and users of profiles MAY define and manage them in a way
        that allows them to be used across media types,"
        so that the "profile" relation seems like a suitable way
        to transport information about acceptable profiles (request) and payload profile (response).</p>
      <pre class="example nohighlight" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite" title="Using a Link header with a profile parameter">
  HEAD /some/other/resource HTTP/1.1
  Accept: text/turtle;q=0.9,application/rdf+xml;q=0.5
  Link: &lt;http://example.com/profile-1&gt;; rel="profile"

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-type: text/turtle
  Link: &lt;http://example.com/profile-1&gt;; rel="profile"
      </pre>
      <p>There is, however, no possibility to convey quality information (q-values) using the “profile” relation.</p>
      <h4>Using the Prefer/Preference-Applied header fields (RFC 7240)</h4>
      <p>The http <code>Prefer</code> and <code>Preference-Applied</code> header fields [[RFC7240]]
      can be used to convey information about profile preferences.
      A client could use the <code>Prefer</code> header to tell the server about
      its preference for a payload conforming to a specific profile.
      If the server sends a <code>Preference-Applied</code> header field in the response,
      the client will know that the preference was honoured.</p>
      <pre class="example nohighlight" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite" title="Using a Link header with a profile parameter">
  GET /some/resource HTTP/1.1
  Accept: text/turtle
  Prefer: profile="urn:example:schema"

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/turtle
  Preference-Applied: profile="urn:example:schema"
      </pre>
      <p>This approach has two disadvantages.
      The first is - as with the <code>Link</code> header,
      that there is no possibility to work with q-values.
      The second one is that the only way for a server to state
      that it ignored the preference stated by the client
      is to omit sending a <code>Preference-Applied</code> header field.
      For the client - however - it is not clear
      if the <code>Preference-Applied</code> header is absent
      because the server did not honour the preference,
      or if it is because the server did not understand
      the <code>Prefer</code> header in the first place.
      This could be solved by making it mandatory to send a
      <code>Link: rel=profil</code> header when answering to a request
      with a <code>Prefer: profile=''</code> header in it.
      That solution requires that a client evaluates two different headers
      in order to find a response to its request for a specific profile,
      which would make client implementation more complicated.</p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="380">
        The Internet-Draft for the registration of
        <code>Accept-Profile</code> and <code>Content-Profile</code>
        is currently work-in progress.
        When that work is completed, the above text will be adjusted accordingly
        or deleted.
      </p>

		  <h3>Archival Resource Key (ARK)</h3>
		  <p>ARK (Archival Resource Key) [[ARK]] is an identifier scheme
			for the persistent identification of information objects.
			ARK identifiers can contain an optional qualifier 
			"that extends the base ARK in order to create a kind of service entry point
			into the object named by the NAA [sc. Name Assigning Authority]."
			Through a qualifier, any NMA (Name Mapping Authority, a service provider offering ARK resolution)
			can supply access to variants of that object.
			The set of qualifiers is open and any ARK NAA or NMA can invent its own.
			The ARK specification lists versions, languages and formats as examples of qualifiers (§2.5)
			and a profile name could be used as a qualifier
			to refer to a representation of an information object conforming to that specific profile.
			For example, the URI <a href="https://api.istex.fr/ark:/67375/6GQ-MLC8GRWC-5/">https://api.istex.fr/ark:/67375/6GQ-MLC8GRWC-5/</a>

      <h3>Linked Data APIs</h3>
      <p>
        Several Linked Data API tools provide access to different representations of resources, identified by URI, via
        use of Query String Arguments (QSAs). Two examples are the
        <a href="http://epimorphics.github.io/elda/current/index.html">ELDA tool by Epimorphics</a>, an
        implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/UKGovLD/linked-data-api/blob/wiki/Specification.md">Linked
        Data API</a> specification created by the government of the United Kingdom, and the <a href="">pyLDAPI</a> Python
        Linked Data API implementation by <a href="https://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>. Both of these tools allow the
        listing of <em>views</em> and <em>formats</em> available for a resource by dereferencing the URL created by
        adding the <abbr title='Query String Argument'>QSA</abbr> <code>_view=alternates</code> to the resource URI. The
        <em>view</em> named <em>alternates</em> is a special view available for all resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        What these tools call a <em>view</em> is analogous to a profile and a <em>format</em> to an HTTP Media Type.
      </p>
      <p>
        These APIs provide for direct access to resource representations, conforming to a particular view, in a
        particular format, or a default view/format if either is unspecified or invalid. For example, using pyLDAPI, the
        available views and formats for the address <a href="http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/gnaf/address/GAACT714845933">GAACT714845933</a>
        can by seen by dereferencing <a href="http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/gnaf/address/GAACT714845933?_view=alternates">http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/gnaf/address/GAACT714845933<strong>?_view=alternates</strong></a>
        and the "ISO19160" <em>view</em> of that Address, listed by the Alternates View, and in the RDF Turtle
        <em>format</em>, is available at <a href="http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/gnaf/address/GAACT714845933?_view=ISO19160&_format=text/turtle">http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/gnaf/address/GAACT714845933<strong>?_view=ISO19160&amp;_format=text/turtle</strong></a>.

      <h3>OAI-PMH</h3>
      <p>
        The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting [[OAI-PMH]] "...provides an
        application-independent interoperability framework based on metadata harvesting." In doing this, OAI-PMH
        specifies Query String Argument-based "Protocol Requests and Responses" that allow clients of
        <em>Data Providers</em> to: retrieve the metadata formats available from a repository
        (<code>ListMetadataFormats</code>); retrieve metadata for an identified record (<code>GetRecord</code>),
        according to an identified metadata profile; perform a number of other repository interrogation tasks; and to
        harvest collections of record's metadata, filtered by parameters such as modified date.
      </p>
      <p>
        OAI-PMH requires that representations of all resources in a repository are available according to the same set
        of profiles. It is also entirely XML-based so that profiles, or "metadata formats" as they are called in OAI-PMH, must
        all be presented in XML and the content of an XML representation of a resource is presented within an XML
        envelope that always identifies the record, the profile, the OAI-PMH method used, the request time and other
        common metadata.

      <h3>Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW)</h3>
      <p>
        [[CSW]] is the OGC standard used world-wide by the geospatial community to implement a machine-actionable interface
	to catalog services, providing access to metadata about datasets, geospatial services ([[WMS]], [[WFS]], etc.), 
	as well as other types of resources. Besides supporting common functions such as free-text and faceted search, CSW supports the retrieval of metadata according to a given metadata schema and format, indicated respectively by using <code>outputSchema</code> and <code>outputFormat</code> query parameters. Commonly supported metadata schemas are [[DC11]], and [[ISO-19115]], and the default format is XML. A given CSW instance's supported metadata schemas and formats are described in the service "capabilities" -- a machine-readable description of the service interface, that is returned via a <code>GetCapabilities</code> request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notably, CSW theoretically supports HTTP content negotiation for the metadata format, and the specification defines a conflict resolution mechanism for requests where this information is specified both via HTTP <code>Accept</code> headers and the <code>outputFormat</code> parameter (see <a href="http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-176r7/12-176r7.html#8">Section 6.2</a> of the <cite>OGC CSW 3.0 specification - HTTP Protocol Binding</cite>).

    <h2>Abstract Model</h2>
    <p>
      This section describes a conceptual, abstract, model for content negotiation by profile, independent of any
      realizations of it within specific environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Realizations of this abstract model MUST implement its functions, but how they do this will be
      environment-specific.
    </p>
    <section id="abstractmodelcontext">
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        All content negotiation takes place between a <a>client</a> and a <a>server</a> over the Internet with the
        former requesting a representation of a <a>resource</a> or a <em>resource</em>'s <em>metadata</em> through a
        <a>request</a> and receiving it via a <a>response</a>. In some cases, a <em>server</em> may have to make a
        <em>request</em> of a <em>client</em> and receive a <em>response</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An Internet <em>resource</em> may have many aspects over which a <em>client</em>/<em>server</em> pair of
        agents might negotiate for content. These aspects are to be treated independently so content negotiation for a 
        resource involving negotiation by profile and any other aspects of a resource will not affect
        each other. For this reason, other than a directive to maintain independence, no further discussion of 
        negotiation by profile and the relations to other forms of negotiation are given. Specific realizations might
        require special handling of profile and other forms of negotiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <em>client</em> <em>request</em>ing the representation of a <em>resource</em> conforming to a <em>profile</em>
        MUST identify the <em>resource</em> by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [[RFC3986]] and MUST
        identify a <em>profile</em> either by a URI or a <em>token</em> that unambiguously identifies the
        <em>profile</em> for the <em>server</em> within that <em>request</em>/<em>response</em> session.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this abstract model, we don't assume any specific details about <em>client</em>, <em>server</em>, <em>resource</em>,
        <em>metadata</em>, <em>request</em> or <em>response</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a URI is used for profile identification, it is recommended that it be an HTTP
        URI that dereferences to a description of the profile. Other kinds or URIs, e. g. URNs <em>MAY</em> also be used however
        systems will need to provide means to describe such profiles for a given URN. When a token is used, the
        server is responsible for declaring the context within which the token may be mapped to a unique profile
        identifier, such as an HTTP namespace.

        There are two main types of <em>request</em> that a <em>client</em> might make of a <em>server</em> regarding
        content negotiation by profile. A <em>client</em> wishing to negotiate for content via a profile adhering to this
        specification MUST be able to implement these two request types.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>list profiles</strong><br />
          a <em>client</em> requests the list of URIs of <em>profile</em>s for which a <em>server</em> is able to deliver
          conformant <em>resource</em>s
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>get resource by profile</strong>
          <br />a <em>client</em> requests a representation of the requested <em>resource</em> represented conforming
          to a particular <em>profile</em>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A <em>server</em> adhering to this specification MUST respond to each request with the following
        <em>response</em>s. 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>list profiles</strong><br />
          a <em>server</em> responds to a <em>client</em> with the list of <em>profile</em> URIs for the <em>profile</em>s for which it is able to
		deliver conformant <em>resource</em> representations 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>get resource by profile</strong><br />
          a <em>server</em> responds with either a specific <em>profile</em> for a <em>resource</em> conforming to a
          requested <em>profile</em> identified by the <em>client</em> or it responds with a default <em>profile</em>

        <h4>list profiles</h4>
        <p>
          A <em>client</em> wishes to know for which <em>profile</em>s a <em>server</em> is able to deliver conformant
          representations of a <em>resource</em>. The content of the list can be known either before a <em>request</em> for a 
          particular <em>resource</em> representation is made or it may only be known after an initial <em>request</em> for a
          <em>resource</em> representation is made.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>list profiles</strong> <em>request</em> MUST be either an independent request or part of another
          realization's request.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>list profiles</strong> <em>request</em> MAY result in a <em>response</em> in one of a
          number of formats provided that the <em>profile</em>s representations of resources
          conform to are unambiguously identified either by URI or a <em>token</em> which MUST be mappable to a URI
          within one particular client/server session.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>server</em> MUST NOT list <em>profile</em>s that <em>resource</em> representations conform to if
          it is unable to deliver those representations when presented with a <strong>get resource by profile</strong>

        <h4>get resource by profile</h4>
        <p>
          The most basic <em>request</em> of content negotiation by profile is for a <em>client</em> to <em>request</em>
          a representation of a <em>resource</em> that is claimed to conform to a <em>profile</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>client</em> executing a <strong>get resource by profile</strong> <em>request</em> MUST
          identify the <em>profile</em> with either a URI or a token mapping unambiguously within a session to a URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>client</em> executing a <strong>get resource by profile</strong> MAY <em>request</em> a
          <em>resource</em> representation conforming to one of any number of <em>profile</em>s with its preference
          expressed in a some form of list ordering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server should attempt to reply with a profile that best matches the client request. The order of
          preference a server <em>MUST</em> follow to determine a best matching profile is: an exact match, followed by
          anything that the profile profiles (a more general specification or profile), perhaps transitively.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a client requests a profile but gets a narrower profile, the Server should set its responses
          Content-Profile header to the profile identifier that the Client requested, not the identifier of the
          narrower profile as the client might not understand the narrower profile identifier.

      <h3>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Headers</h3>
      <p>
        A realization of the Abstract Model using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) headers is presented here.
        This implementation is based on HTTP content negotiation and uses two new HTTP headers,
	      <code>Accept-Profile</code> and <code>Content-Profile</code>
	      that are to be defined in an upcoming Internet-Draft [[PROF-IETF]].

        <h3>list profiles</h3>
        <p>
          The preferred way to retrieve a list of profiles the server supports for a specific resource
	  is to issue a <code>GET</code> or <code>HEAD</code> request for that resource.
	  In either case, a server implementing
          content negotiation by profile SHOULD return an HTTP <code>Link</code> header containing information about the
          default representation of that resource and information about any alternate representations of that
          resource that that conform to potentially other profiles. The returned representation will be identified by <code>rel="self"</code>, other representations by
          <code>rel="alternate"</code>.
        </p>
        <p>As an example, consider the resource <code>http://example.org/a/resource</code> available
          in the Media Types <code>application/xml</code>, <code>text/html</code> and <code>text/turtle</code>.
          The <code>text/html</code> representation has
          no profile, whereas the <code>application/xml</code> and <code>text/turtle</code> representations are
          both available in the profiles <code>urn:example:profile:1</code> and <code>urn:example:profile:2</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All representations of <code>/a/resource</code> have Content-Location URLs. This results in the following matrix:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Media Type / Profile</th><th>urn:example:profile:1</th><th>urn:example:profile:2</th></tr>
          <tr><th>text/html</th><td>http://example.org/a/resource.html</td><td>http://example.org/a/resource.html</td></tr>
          <tr><th>text/turtle</th><td>http://example.org/a/resource.prof1.ttl</td><td>http://example.org/a/resource.prof2.ttl</td></tr>
          <tr><th>application/xml</th><td>http://example.org/a/resource.prof1.xml</td><td>http://example.org/a/resource.prof2.xml</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Assuming that a request without an <code>Accept-Profile</code> header per default delivers content conforming to
          <code>urn:example:profile:1</code>, an HTTP request/response pair would look as follows:

          <div class="note" title="Multiple ways of conveying URI / token mappings">
            <p>
              There are several methods that many be used to convey URI / token mappings including the recommended
              method described and exemplified above.
            </p>
            <h4>Option 1: token parameters (recommended)</h4>
            <p>
              "token" parameters are added to <code>Content-Profile</code> &amp; <code>Link profile=</code> HTT headers.<br />
              Pros: self-contained,flexible, explicit.<br />
              Cons: potential redundancy in URIs if many offered
            </p>
            <h4>Option 2: registered tokens</h4>
            <p>
              Tokens are registered in a global registry and servers may use them in place of a URI<br />
              <code>Content-profile: token1, URI2</code>
              Pros: compact<br />
              Cons: a global registry for profiles not manageable when many systems define profiles and such a registry
              limits other capabilities of profile description by forcing generic profiles
            </p>
            <h4>Option 3: allow namespace declarations</h4>
            <p>
              As per the use of CURIEs [[CURIE]] whose specification "...defines a generic, abbreviated syntax for
              expressing URIs.", within JSON-LD [[JSON-LD]], a token may be indicated for use in place of a URI within
              a namespacing context. In this method, key/value pairs of tokens/URIs are defined within an HTTP header
              such as <code>Content-Profile</code> like this:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>Content-Profile: @:http://example.org/profiles/,@w3c:http://w3.org/knownprofiles#, :token1, w3c:token2</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Where the first key/value pair of token/URI is key: &lt;nothing&gt;, value: http://example.org/profiles/
              and the second, is key: &lt;w3c&gt;, value:http://w3.org/knownprofiles#.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pros: compact, no registry requirement<br />
              Cons: clients have more parsing to do<br />
              Note: could easily be a JSON-LD payload<br />
              (alternative syntax using parameter ns2;ns=http://example.org/profiles/)
            </p>
            <h4>Option 4: namespace header</h4>
            <p>
              In this method, a new HTTP header could be introduced to specifically convey token/URI profile key/value
              pairs. If <code>Content-Profile-Namespaces</code> is to be the new HTTP header, then a <em>server</em> may
              respond to a request with the following pair of headers:
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>
                Content-Profile-Namespaces: :http://example.org/profiles/,w3c:http://w3.org/knownprofiles#<br />
                Content-Profile: :token1, w3c:token2

      <p>
        While the HTTP-header approach to profiles enables fully automated retrieval of data conforming 
	to a desired profile, it is also advisable to enable humans to select data by profile without 
	requiring direct manipulation of request header content. This can be accomplished by existing 
	web development methods where an API supports a graphical interface. The user can be presented 
	with a list of available profiles and given the choice of which to retrieve for the dataset of 
	interest. They can even be asked to indicate a ranked choice of possible profiles, which could 
	then be used to retrieve multiple resources' data matching a query. 
      </p>
      <p>
	As one example of how an API for such a service can be implemented, a Query String Argument (QSA) 
	realization of the <a href="#abstractmodel">Abstract Model</a> is presented here. Unlike the HTTP-header 
	realization, which is also the subject of an independent IETF document [[PROF-IETF]], this realization 
	is fully specified here but it is not normative. This realization does not preclude other URL schemes, 
	or even other QSA schemes, for profile negotiation, the general requirement being that any scheme 
	implements the functions of the Abstract Model. Whatever specific scheme is used, it should be fully 
	documented and discoverable.
      </p>
      <p>
        A query string is a part of a URL which assigns values to specified parameters. QSAs are commonly used within
        web browsers by humans and in other <em>client</em>/<em>server</em> situations to deliver extra information to a
        <em>server</em>.
      </p>
      <div class="note" title="Maximum length of URLs">
	<p>
	  Since Query String Arguments use URIs (or URLs) to convey important information,
	  implementers should ensure that the total length of the URL
	  does not exceed possible length restrictions.
	  [[RFC7230]] <a data-cite="RFC7230#section-3.1.1">§3.1.1</a> recommends
	  that senders and recipients support request lines of at least 8,000 octets.
	  Some client and server implementations, however,
	  cannot accept URLs longer than 2,000 characters
	  and e. g. the Sitemap protocol has a length limit of 2,048 characters in a URL.
	  Cf. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/417142/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-url-in-different-browsers">this question on stackoverflow</a>
	  for a longer discussion of issues related to URL length.

      <div class="issue" data-number="511"></div>
      <p>
        When content negotiation by profile is to take place using QSAs, the <em>request</em>s and <em>response</em>s
        of the <a href="#abstractmodel">Abstract Model</a> can be implemented by using key/value pairs using key terms of the implementer's choosing.
	      In this realization, <code>_profile</code> and <code>_mediatype</code> are used
	      to indicate a single profile or a list of
        preference-ordered profiles, or one or more Media types, respectively, with profiles or Media Types indicated by either URI or
        token.
      </p>
      <div class="note" title="Current use of tokens for negotiation by Media Type">
        <p>
          Currently, the convention in HTTP content negotiation by media type uses tokens for Media Types, such as
          <code>text/html</code> or <code>application/ld+json</code> with the tokens registered at
          <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types">IANA's Media Types list</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no proposal yet to create a central register of profiles, as this is thought by the authors to be
          unsustainable in the long term, given the likely numbers of profiles to be established.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, this QSA realization allows either URIs or tokens for profiles to be used, and it is expected that other URL-based realizations will also allow URIs or tokens for Media Types and other
          content negotiation dimensions, such as language. There are already several initiatives that have created URIs
          for Media Types based on the IANA registry's tokens.

      </div>
      <p><strong><em>Resource URL</em></strong></p>
      <p>
        Resource URLs for which QSA-based profile negotiation is taking place should not themselves be QSA values
        of other resource URIs in any QSA-based realization. Such mechanics may be used internally but are best kept transparent to the
        realization's <em>client</em> applications.

        </p>
        <pre class="example nohighlight" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite" title="Requesting a list of profiles for a resource by QSA">
GET /a/resource?_profile=list HTTP/1.1
        </pre>
        <!--
        <p><code>RESOURCE_URL?_profile=list</code></p>
        <p>where</p>
        -->
        <p>
          where <code>/a/resource</code> is the URL of the resource for which the list of available profiles is
          requested
        </p>
        <p>
          It's possible for a <em>client</em> making this <em>request</em> to negotiate for particular formats of the response by
          using a QSA equivalent to the HTTP <code>Accept</code> header to indicate a Media Type. The <em>server</em>
          would implement a <code>_mediatype</code> QSA for this but might offer an alternative, such
          as <code>_format</code>, as long as this is discoverable.
        </p>
        <p>An example <em>profile</em> listing for a <em>resource</em> in HTML would look like:
        </p>
        <!--<p><code>RESOURCE_URL?_profile=list&_mediatype=text/html</code></p>-->
        <pre class="example nohighlight" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite" title="Requesting a list of profiles for a resource by QSA in HTML">
GET /a/resource?_profile=list&amp;_mediatype=text/html HTTP/1.1
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section id="getresourcebyprofileqsa">
        <h4>get resource by profile</h4>
        <div class="issue" title="To be completed"></div>

        <p><strong><em>Expressing profile preference</em></strong></p>
        <p>
          A <em>server</em> implementing <em>profile</em> listing for <em>resource</em>s could allow the
          requester to indicate preferences by allowing the QSA indicating the desired
          profile, e.g., <code>_profile</code>, to have a comma-separated list as its value so, for a
          <em>client</em> desiring representations of <code>/a/resource</code> according to profiles with tokens
          <code>aaa</code>, <code>bbb</code> &amp; <code>ccc</code> we have:
        </p>
        <pre class="example nohighlight" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite" title="Requesting a list of profiles for a resource by QSA in HTML">
  GET /a/resource?_profile=aaa,bbb,ccc HTTP/1.1
        </pre>
        <p>
          Servers can support any combination of profile URIs or tokens for this
		(e.g. <code>aaa,http://example.org/profile-x,bbb</code>).
		However, in this situation, profile URIs containing commas would need to be escaped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, a <em>server</em> implementing multiple Media Type return formats for its <em>profile</em> listing should
          allow a client to specify a preference order for Media Types and also for other dimensions of content
          negotiation, such as language. When using a QSA-only API, Media Type preferences (and language and others in a
          similar fashion) can be specified in a comma-separated list form, most preferred to least, such that
          a client requesting profiles as <code>aaa,bbb,ccc</code> will receive a resource that meets the requirements of profile 
	  <code>aaa</code> if it is available, else one that meets profile <code>bbb</code> if that is available, and so on.

    <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The use of HTTP to negotiate and transport implies that all privacy and security issues
      that are relevant for that protocol are also relevant for profile negotiation. E. g.,
      information such as user agent, accept-headers, IP address etc. can potentially be used as
      identifying information, and particularly, the IP address adds information about geolocation
      and institutional membership.
      Further, offering a list of acceptable profiles at the beginning of a negotiation process
      can reveal information about the user's interests
      that could be used to add such information to a user profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a more complete view of those issues, cf. the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/CnegPrivacyAndSecurityQuestionnaire">Privacy and Security Questionnaire for this deliverable</a>.

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        This section lists, and then addresses, individual requirements that the Dataset Exchange Working Group
        considered important for content negotiation by profile.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Responses to individual requirement Issues listed here are, at the time of the First Public Working Draft of
          this document, for demonstration only; to indicate the logic of answers to individual requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          These requirement responses may not survive in their current form in later drafts of this document nor may
          individual listings of requirements; they may be subsumed into the flowing txt of the document.

        <p class="respTitle">RESPONSE FOR Req. 74</p>
        <p>
          This requirement is the focus of the IETF RFC in the DXWG Family of Documents [[PROF-IETF]].
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, a series of new HTTP headers are added to the HTTP specification allowing for HTTP negotiation
          via profile in a manner similar to negotiation via Media Type or Language.

          <em>(assuming wording of "a profile must have an identifier")</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Profiles must be identified by an HTTP URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Short codes (tokens) for profiles that map to HTTP URIs for them may be used in systems that ensure the
          tokens map deterministically. This allows for the use of simple strings in places where URIs are impractical
          yet preserves the guarantee that every profile has an HTTP URI.
